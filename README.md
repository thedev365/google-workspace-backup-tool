## Why do we need to backup Google Workspace emails?

Google Workspace provides a retention period to recover data from deleted files. However, their inbuilt tools cannot restore accidentally or permanently deleted data. Google Workspace backup files are essential to prevent user data from:

### Accidental deletion or overwriting

When multiple users work on a project simultaneously, the chances of overwriting and accidental deletion increase. Sometimes, the original file gets deleted mistakenly, or someone overwrites the crucial data. In such a scenario, backup Google Workspace emails and prevent data from accidental deletion or overwriting.

### Cyber, malware, or ransomware attacks

Many business organizations often lose their important Google Workspace mailbox data due to cyber-attacks, malware, or ransomware attacks. To safeguard organizations data from ransomware attacks and encrypting the data, needs lots of money. Instead of consuming money, take a backup at a safe location.

### Unauthorized access or internal threats

If an unauthorized user accesses the Google Workspace admin account or any employee leaks internal information, this will compromise data confidentiality. Additionally, the organization may lose control of the Google Workspace account. Thus, a backup is needed to recover data from Google Workspace.

### SaaS outages and technical issues

Technical issues or SaaS outages hamper the workflow due to a lack of accessibility. Moreover, an outage can cause some severe issues, such as a chance of data loss when regaining the connection. At this time, only the G Suite backup and restore tool can protect the important Google Mail data.

### Creating backup or data loss during migration

When performing the data migration for a merger or acquisition of a business organization, the risk of data loss increases by 2X because of source and destination permissions. Creating a backup of old data is necessary for every organization to avoid data loss and fulfill legal compliances.

### Employee leaving the organization

When an employee leaves the organization, the respective user account needs to migrate their data into a safer place and perform deletion. However, before migration and deletion of the account, all the crucial data from Google Workspace must be backed up to the local or network drive of the system.

## Why Choose Our G Suite Backup Tool

Google Workspace limits recovery options, and hence, once the data is permanently deleted, it has gone. This is why it is always a wise choice to rely on third-party Google Workspace backup tool to protect the data. Kernel G Suite backup tool provides the following benefits:

How can I control the backup size when I backups G Suite data periodically?

What is the benefit of using a CSV file?

How does the software save the data in the output files for multiple accounts?

I have created multiple folders in the mailbox to save some emails separately. Will the software access such folders?

What credentials are required to backup G Suite mailboxes?

What does the P 12 key do for the service account?

A Service account is a special account for using Google API programming. It creates a key to access the account without additional authentication. You need the P 12 key to connect our tool with the service account.

What is the need for a Super Administrator account to backup multiple accounts?

A Super Administrator has greater control over Google Cloud resources. It has irrevocable administrative permissions that can control Google apps like Docs, Sheets, Drive, user mailboxes, etc. A super administrator can also create a service account with the authority to access other Google apps. When you want to take a backup of multiple accounts, then you need the Super Administrator account ID to access the accounts of all the users.

I have a PST file with 28 GB in size. Can I restore it to single Workspace accounts?

Can I back up Gmail and Google Drive Trash folder?

I am not able to backup Contacts and Calendar/Appointments using the tool. How can I fix the issue?

The Google Workspace backup tool can backup Contacts and Calendar/Appointments only if the API is enabled. To enable API,

- Go to go to - https://console.developers.google.com.
- Go to your domain and ensure the new/existing project has the required API enabled.
![google calendar api](https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/imagenew20/stepsscreen/g-suite-backup/google-api.jpg)


While using the software, an error occurred before the filter page. It showed that "Google.Apis.Requests.Request Error User-rate limit exceeded" - Is there a method to remove such errors?

Actually, you are required to increase the limit of the APIs related to the apps in the G Suite accounts. You need to submit a request to increase the quota for related API.

- Log in to the Google cloud platform using the URL â€“ [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- In the IAM and admin category, click on **Quotas**.
![click on Quotas](https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/imagenew20/stepsscreen/g-suite-backup/quotas.jpg)

- Choose the API whose limit you want to increase. Then, choose the **Edit Quotas** option.

- Input a new limit and click the **Submit Request** option.
![Click on Submit Request option](https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/imagenew20/stepsscreen/g-suite-backup/new-limit.jpg)
Similarly, you can change the quota limit of other APIs too.

You ask for P12 key while backup, but JSON key during restore process. What is the difference between these two keys?

P12 keys come with a certificate in the form of a PKCS#12 bundle, whereas JSON keys can obtain the certificate from Google SDK website. This is the primary distinction between P12 and JSON keys. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is signed with the certificate and sent to Google OAuth 2.0 servers to request an access token. After that, API requests are authorized using the access token.

Email, UserDisplayName
user1@yourdomain.com, User One
user2@yourdomain.com, User Two
